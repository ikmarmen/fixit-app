Hi guys,
Please, find bellow the summary and our decisions made during webex call.

1. Alerts
We decided to use push notifications for now. We will use react native fire-base push notifications library to send notifications to android and ios users.
If I am not wrong, here is the library url https://github.com/evollu/react-native-fcm

2. Mockups
Ani will update existing mockups and create colored ones till Monday 14/08/2017 (Armenia).
After meeting and product owners approval, Ani will start development of the FixIt UI. She can/will use the following tools:
a) https://nativebase.io/
b) https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons

3. Code review and planning
Arsen will have a look to existing codes. We will have a meeting on Friday morning or Monday morning to discuss Arsen`s findings/remarks. 
More specifically:
a) How to solve issue with 6MB restriction
b) How to use geolocation recognition. (we don`t see the real scenario for background recognition usage)
c) Social Logins. Arsen has a codes and probably can nest them in FixIt project
d) Identify the parts of the project, which Arsen can do till the end of the month.

If I missed something, please let me know.
